## Portfolio Website
A simple personal portfolio website created using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`.

Created to satisfy the portfolio project required by the front-end development course in Codecademy. Drew inspiration from another
portfolio website, recreated from scratch only using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. May continue to expand it and make it a full-blown portfolio website, but using `React`.
